## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

1. How would the customer be calssified? This customer would be classified in the 0 (no loan category).

2. What is a choice of k that balances between overfitting and ignoring the predictor
information? We choose the value of k at 3 as it provides the best result.

3. Show the confusion matrix for the validation data that results from using the best k
prediction    0    1
         0 1801   77
         1    7  114

4. the kNN model predicted that the new customer will accept a loan offer.

5. The model had better performance in the test set, this is due to the fact that it learned about 80% of the data. In the training data set, we only taught kNN about 50% of the data. With the test set we receieved better accuracy because more data was learned.
