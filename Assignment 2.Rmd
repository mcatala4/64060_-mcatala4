## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

1. How would the customer be calssified? This customer would be classified in the 0 (no loan category).

2. What is a choice of k that balances between overfitting and ignoring the predictor
information? We choose the value of k at 3 as it provides the best result.
accuracy.df <- data.frame(k = seq(1, 60, 1), accuracy = rep(0, 60))
> for(i in 1:60) {
+ prediction <- knn(train = train.norm.df[,-7], test = valid.norm.df[-7], 
+                   cl = train.norm.df[,7], k = i, prob=TRUE)
+ accuracy.df[i,2] <- mean(prediction==actual)
+ }
> accuracy.df

3. Show the confusion matrix for the validation data that results from using the best k
prediction    0    1
         0 1801   77
         1    7  114
> set.seed(2019)
> prediction <- knn(train = train.norm.df[,-7], test = valid.norm.df[,-7], 
+                   cl = train.norm.df[,7], k = 3, prob=TRUE)
> actual= valid.norm.df$Personal.Loan
> prediction_prob = attr(prediction,"prob")
> table(prediction,actual)

4. the kNN model predicted that the new customer will accept a loan offer.
> prediction_test <- knn(train = maindata.norm.df[,-7], test = Test_Data, 
+                        cl = maindata.norm.df[,7], k = 1, prob=TRUE)

5. The model had better performance in the test set, this is due to the fact that it learned about 80% of the data. In the training data set, we only taught kNN about 50% of the data. With the test set we receieved better accuracy because more data was learned.
